## Introduction

Polisher is a tool to identify common typographical errors in LaTeX files, such as punctuation errors, etc. It is highly configurable; in particular, one can define regexp expressions that are forbidden. The program will only highlight errors, it currently does not allow for editing corrections.

The software is currently in an beta state. Suggestions for improvement are welcome.
