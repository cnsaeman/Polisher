To start polisher, type java -jar Polisher.jar in the installation directory.

## Introduction

This is a little java program that highlights problematic sections of drafts of scientific papers written in LaTeX. It allows you to edit these things directly. Essentially all of the highlighting can be configured via regular expressions, which are stored in "rules.cfg".

The software is currently in an alpha state. Suggestions for improvement are welcome.
